# LibraryAnimation
I came up with the idea for this one day while listening to `Voile, the Magic Library` (the song it plays). I have no rights to the music; it's from Touhou 12.3: Unthinkable Natural Law. Listen on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/a660fhaF08s

I additionally do not own any rights to the image of Patchouli, which is a wonderful piece made by Takeka Fungi who you can check out on Pixiv here: https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/53756787

Nor can I claim the Minecraft Bookshelf Texture which is tiled to make the walls, floor, and ceiling.

Finally, I DO claim the rights to the code! You can use it for whatever you'd like, though. I tried to comment well and it'd mean a lot to me if you learn anything from taking a look.
